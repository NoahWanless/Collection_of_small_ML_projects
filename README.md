################################## INTRO: ##################################
This is a collection of smaller Data Science/ Machine learning projects I have done for both school and personally.
Most (all at the time of writing at least) are jupyter notebooks, and within them contain a overview of what the project goal was.
However here i will also provide a quick overview of all of them.


################################## NOTES: ##################################
Most of these were made with the use of the sklearn python module to create these models



################################## Project list: ##################################

### chicago_crashes
Goal: Create a model that would demonstrate what factors contribute to a fataily crash when a bike rider is involed

### diabetes_pred
Goal: Using Patient data, predicte whether they have diabetes or not

Data:

### federalist_papers_authors
Goal: Predict the authors of the 12 federalist papers with disputed authorship

Data: My instructor provided it

### kaggle_class_project
Goal: Predict labels based on features (using fake dataset my teacher made)

Data: My instructor provided it

Score:
test_set_1: score: 18.568 (Rank 1 in the class)
test_set_2: score: 16.185 (Rank 4 in the class)

NOTE: I think the 'score' in Kaggle is the MSE score but I dont know for sure

### kaggle_housing
Goal: Predict hosuing prices 

Data: Kaggle provided


### seattle_bike_crossing
Goal: Determine trends in how often people cross a certain bridge in seattle (which has a device to see how many bikes cross it each day)

Data: Take from the following website:
